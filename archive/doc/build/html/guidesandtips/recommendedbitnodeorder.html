<dl>
<dt>Description</dt><dd><p>Organized crime groups quickly filled the void of power left behind from the collapse of
Western government in the 2050s. As society and civlization broke down, people quickly
succumbed to the innate human impulse of evil and savagery. The organized crime
factions quickly rose to the top of the modern world.</p>
<p>In this BitNode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Your hacking level is reduced by 20%</p></li>
<li><p>The growth rate and maximum amount of money available on servers are significantly decreased</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of money gained from crimes and Infiltration is tripled</p></li>
<li><p>Certain Factions (Slum Snakes, Tetrads, The Syndicate, The Dark Army, Speakers for the Dead,
NiteSec, The Black Hand) give the player the ability to form and manage their own gangs. These gangs
will earn the player money and reputation with the corresponding Faction</p></li>
<li><p>Every Augmentation in the game will be available through the Factions listed above</p></li>
<li><p>For every Faction NOT listed above, reputation gains are halved</p></li>

</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Difficulty</dt><dd><p>Fairly easy, as hacking is still very profitable and the costs of various purchases/upgrades
is not increased. The gang mechanic may seem strange as its very different from anything
else, but it can be very powerful once you get the hang of it.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt><dd><p>Our greatest illusion is that a healthy society can revolve around a
single-minded pursuit of wealth.
Sometime in the early 21st century economic and political globalization turned
the world into a corporatocracy, and it never looked back. Now, the privileged
elite will happily bankrupt their own countrymen, decimate their own community,
and evict their neighbors from houses in their desperate bid to increase their wealth.
In this BitNode you can create and manage your own corporation. Running a successful corporation
has the potential of generating massive profits. All other forms of income are reduced by 75%. Furthermore:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The price and reputation cost of all Augmentations is tripled</p></li>
<li><p>The starting and maximum amount of money on servers is reduced by 75%</p></li>
<li><p>Server growth rate is reduced by 80%</p></li>

<p>Intelligence is unique because it is permanent and persistent (it never gets reset back to 1). However
gaining Intelligence experience is much slower than other stats, and it is also hidden (you won’t know

<h3>BitNode-10: Digital Carbon<a class="headerlink" href="#bitnode-10-digital-carbon" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt><dd><p>In 2084, VitaLife unveiled to the world the Persona Core, a technology that allowed people
to digitize their consciousness. Their consciousness could then be transferred into Synthoids
or other bodies by trasmitting the digitized data. Human bodies became nothing more than ‘sleeves’
for the human consciousness. Mankind had finally achieved immortality - at least for those
that could afford it.</p>
<p>This BitNode unlocks Sleeve technology. Sleeve technology allows you to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Re-sleeve: Purchase and transfer your consciousness into a new body</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate Sleeves: Duplicate your consciousness into Synthoids, allowing you to perform different tasks synchronously</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In this BitNode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Your stats are significantly decreased</p></li>
<li><p>All methods of gaining money are half as profitable (except Stock Market)</p></li>
<li><p>Purchased servers are more expensive, have less max RAM, and a lower maximum limit</p></li>
<li><p>Augmentations are 5x as expensive and require twice as much reputation</p></li>

<h3>BitNode-11: The Big Crash<a class="headerlink" href="#bitnode-11-the-big-crash" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt><dd><p>The 2050s was defined by the massive amounts of violent civil unrest and anarchic rebellion that rose all around the world. It was this period
of disorder that eventually lead to the governmental reformation of many global superpowers, most notably
the USA and China. But just as the world was slowly beginning to recover from these dark times, financial catastrophe hit.
In many countries, the high cost of trying to deal with the civil disorder bankrupted the governments. In all of this chaos and confusion, hackers
were able to steal billions of dollars from the world’s largest electronic banks, prompting an international banking crisis as
governments were unable to bail out insolvent banks. Now, the world is slowly crumbling in the middle of the biggest economic crisis of all time.</p>
<p>In this BitNode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Your hacking stat and experience gain are halved</p></li>
<li><p>The starting and maximum amount of money available on servers is significantly decreased</p></li>
<li><p>The growth rate of servers is significantly reduced</p></li>
<li><p>Weakening a server is twice as effective</p></li>
<li><p>Company wages are decreased by 50%</p></li>
<li><p>Corporation valuations are 99% lower and are therefore significantly less profitable</p></li>
<li><p>Hacknet Node production is significantly decreased</p></li>
<li><p>Crime and Infiltration are more lucrative</p></li>
<li><p>Augmentations are twice as expensive</p></li>

<p>Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 11, or if you already have this Source-File it will
upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File makes it so that company favor increases BOTH
the player’s salary and reputation gain rate at that company by 1% per favor (rather than just the reputation gain).
This Source-File also increases the player’s company salary and reputation gain multipliers by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Level 1: 32%</p></li>
<li><p>Level 2: 48%</p></li>

<h2>Recommended BitNodes<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-bitnodes" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>As a player, you are not forced to tackle the BitNodes in any particular order. You are
free to choose whichever ones you want. The “best” order can vary between players,
depending on what you like to do any what kind of player you are. In general, here
are the recommended BitNodes for different things:</p>
<section id="for-fast-progression">
<h3>For fast progression<a class="headerlink" href="#for-fast-progression" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This does not recommend the absolute fastest path, as I don’t know what
exactly the fastest path is. But it does recommend the BitNodes that are
commonly considered to be optimal by players.</p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Repeat <strong>BitNode-1: Source Genesis</strong> until you max out its Source-File. Its Source-File
is extremely powerful, as it raises all multipliers by a significant amount.</p></li>
<li><p>Do <strong>BitNode-5: Artificial Intelligence</strong> once or twice. The intelligence stat it unlocks
will gradually build up as you continue to play the game, and will be helpful
in the future. The Source-File also provides hacking multipliers, which are
strong because hacking is typically one of the best ways of earning money.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Consider doing <strong>BitNode-4: The Singularity</strong>. Its Source-File does not directly make you
more powerful in any way, but it does unlock the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.singularity.md">Singularity API</a> which
let you automate significantly more aspects of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Do <strong>BitNode-3: Corporatocracy</strong> once to unlock the Corporation mechanic. This mechanic
has high profit potential.</p></li>
<li><p>Do <strong>BitNode-6: Bladeburners</strong> once to unlock the Bladeburners mechanic. The Bladeburner
mechanic is useful for some of the future BitNodes (such as 9 and 10).</p></li>
<li><p>Do <strong>BitNode-9: Hacktocracy</strong> to unlock the Hacknet Server mechanic. You can
consider repeating it as well, as its Level 2 and 3 effects are pretty helpful as well.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition-todo admonition" id="id1">
<p class="admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p>To be continued as more BitNodes get added</p>
</div>

<section id="for-the-strongest-source-files">
<h3>For the strongest Source-Files<a class="headerlink" href="#for-the-strongest-source-files" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Note that the strongest Source-Files are typically rewarded by the hardest BitNodes.</p>
<p>The strongest Source-File is that from <strong>BitNode-1: Source Genesis</strong>, as it raises
all multipliers by a significant amount.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Source-File from <strong>BitNode-12: The Recursion</strong> is also very strong
because it raises all multipliers. Each level of Source-File 12 is fairly weak,
but its effectiveness gets better over time since the effects of Source-Files and
Augmentations are multiplicative with each other.</p>
<p>The Source-File from <strong>BitNode-9: Hacktocracy</strong> is good because it unlocks the Hacknet
Server mechanic. The Hacknet Server mechanic causes Hacknet Nodes to produce a new
currency called <em>hashes</em>, rather than money. <em>Hashes</em> can be spent on powerful upgrades
that benefit your hacking, Corporation, Bladeburner, etc.</p>
<p>The Duplicate Sleeves granted by the Source-File from <strong>BitNode-10: Digital Carbon</strong>
are strong, but only after you have several of them and have spent some time/money upgrading
them.</p>

<section id="for-more-scripting-hacking">
<h3>For more scripting/hacking<a class="headerlink" href="#for-more-scripting-hacking" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><strong>BitNode-4: The Singularity</strong> unlocks the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.singularity.md">Singularity API</a>, which
can be used to automate many different aspects of the game, including working for factions/companies,
purchasing &amp; installing Augmentations, and creating programs</p>
<p><strong>BitNode-6</strong> and <strong>BitNode-7</strong> unlock Bladeburner and its corresponding
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.bladeburner.md">Netscript API</a>. This allows you to automate an entire
new mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld</strong> also unlocks a new mechanic and Netscript API for automating
it (the Gang mechanic). However, it is not as interesting as Bladeburner (in my opinion)</p>
<p><strong>BitNode-9: Hacktocracy</strong> unlocks the Hacknet Server mechanic and several new
functions in the <a class="reference internal" href="../netscript/netscripthacknetnodeapi.html#netscript-hacknetnodeapi"><span class="std std-ref">Hacknet Node API</span></a> for using it.</p>
</section>
<section id="for-new-mechanics">
<h3>For new mechanics<a class="headerlink" href="#for-new-mechanics" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><strong>BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld</strong> unlocks a new mechanic in which you can
manage a gang. Gangs earn you money and can be very profitable once they get large
and powerful. The biggest benefit of gangs, however, is that they make all
Augmentations available to you through their corresponding faction.</p>
<p><strong>BitNode-3: Corporatocracy</strong> unlocks a new mechanic in which you can manage a
corporation. You can earn money through Corporations by selling your stocks, or by
configuring your corporation to pay dividends to shareholders. If your Corporation
gets big enough, it can also bribe factions in exchange for faction reputation.</p>
<p><strong>BitNode-6: Bladeburners</strong> unlocks a new mechanic that centers around combat rather
than hacking. The main benefit of the Bladeburner mechanic is that it offers a new
method of destroying a BitNode.</p>
<p><strong>BitNode-9: Hacktocracy</strong> unlocks the Hacknet Server, which is an upgraded version of a
Hacknet Node. The Hacknet Server generates a computational unit called a <em>hash</em>. <em>Hashes</em>
can be spent on a variety of different upgrades that can benefit your hacking,
Corporation, Bladeburner progress, and more. It transforms the Hacknet Node from a
simple money-generator to a more interesting mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>BitNode-10: Digital Carbon</strong> unlocks two new mechanics: Re-Sleeving and
Duplicate Sleeves.</p>
</section>
<section id="for-a-challenge">
<h3>For a Challenge<a class="headerlink" href="#for-a-challenge" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>In general, the higher BitNodes are more difficult than the lower ones.
<strong>BitNode-12: The Recursion</strong> is an obvious exception as it gets progressively harder.</p>
<p><strong>BitNode-8: Ghost of Wall Street</strong> provides a unique challenge as the only method
of earning money in that BitNode is through trading at the stock market.</p>
